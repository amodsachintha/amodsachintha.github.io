<p class="font_8">C++ is a powerful language, yeah powerful than java or python. C++ evolved from the C programming language. The C language was evolved at Bell Laboratories by Dennis Ritchie from a language called B in 1972. By the late 1970s, C had evolved into a industry standard language.<br />
Today data compressors, game engines, music players, audio/video decoders are written using C++, and guess what, the speed and low level hardware access is what makes people to use C++.</p>
<p class="font_8"><!--more--></p>
<p class="font_8">The above image is a part of a program I wrote to calculate and output certain values into files. Some times it may seem hard to grasp it at first sight, but believe me, you can ease into it.</p>
<p class="font_8">I won't probably drag my C++ blog posts into graphics simulations, as they are more complex applications of C++. But let's see what becomes of it. ;)</p>
<p class="font_8"><img class=" size-full wp-image-35 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/c-graphics.png" alt="c++ graphics.png" width="643" height="477" /><br />
Knowing some C++ doesn't mean that one can become a game engine developer overnight or nevertheless in a month. Sometimes it takes years of practice to master the language alone enough.<br />
But, word of advice, never give up. Give what it takes to learn it, and you can be proud as hell when you've written it down on you're resume.</p>
<p class="font_8"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-36" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/55728977.jpg" alt="55728977.jpg" width="400" height="400" /></p>
<p class="font_8">C++ is a low level programming language. Meaning you don't encounter a whole lot of English keywords when using it. More recent programming languages tend to have meaning when reading the code itself.</p>
<p class="font_8">It'a probably one reason that C++ is said to be difficult.</p>
<p class="font_8">But don't you worry. Once you take<br />
your time and practice you'll know exactly what should be done at a given situation.</p>
<p class="font_8">So, here's the breakdown,</p>
<ul class="font_8">
<li>
<p class="font_8">I will be posting C++ lessons that covers the most basic stuff, and from there onward more complex stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_8">Videos will be posted too. So be sure to check'em out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_8">Lessons will be based on what I've learnt in the first semester at SLIIT. So students in the first semester at SLIIT will benefit greatly from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_8">Any one new to programming in C++ or new to programming itself, this will be a good start point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_8">Sample code will also be posted. Copy paste compile and run, no worries, but, I'd prefer you yourself taking time to write that code down yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_8">PRACTICE! PRACTICE! or teach someone else what you know. That's the only way this is gonna stick in your head till the semester finals. :3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="font_8">And finally, DO NOT MEMORIZE CODE!!! I have to emphasize the fact that programming in C++ is that you have to improvise on the go. This DOESN'T mean jotting down code from memory.<br />
Learn how to logically write down a program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="font_8">The next blog post will be about setting up an environment for C++ programming. So tune in when.</p>
<p class="font_8"> Cheers and Thank you.<br />
So long till the next post!</p>
